### Theory

#### Step 1: Unbox Your VR Headset
1. **Check the Package Contents:**
   - Headset
   - Controllers
   - Charging cables
   - Link cable (if needed)
   - Power adapter
   - Quick start guide

---

#### Step 2: Power Up the Devices
1. **Charge the Headset and Controllers:**
   - Connect the charging cable to the headset and controllers.
   - Charge them until the indicator lights show full charge.

2. **Turn on the Headset:**
   - Press the power button on the headset for a few seconds until it powers up.

---

#### Step 3: Connect the Headset
1. **Standalone VR Headset (e.g., Meta Quest):**
   - Use Wi-Fi: Follow the on-screen instructions to connect to your Wi-Fi network.
   - Log into your account (Meta, Oculus, etc.).

2. **PC/Console-Connected Headset (e.g., HTC Vive, PSVR, or Valve Index):**
   - **For PC:**
     - Connect the headset to your PC using the link cable or wireless adapter.
     - Install VR software like SteamVR or the manufacturer’s proprietary software.
   - **For Console (e.g., PSVR):**
     - Connect the headset to the console using the supplied cables and adapters.

---

#### Step 4: Set Up the Play Area
1. **Room-Scale VR Setup:**
   - Clear the area of obstacles.
   - Mark the play boundary using the VR system’s guardian or boundary feature.

2. **Stationary Setup:**
   - Sit comfortably in a chair and set the boundary to a stationary mode.

---

#### Step 5: Pair Controllers
1. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
   - Most VR headsets will prompt you to pair the controllers during the setup process.

2. **Manual Pairing:**
   - Hold down the pairing button on the controllers.
   - Follow the LED indicators to confirm successful pairing.

---

#### Step 6: Adjust the Headset
1. **Fit the Headset Comfortably:**
   - Adjust the straps so the headset sits snugly but not too tight.
   - Ensure the lenses are aligned with your eyes for optimal clarity.

2. **Adjust IPD (Interpupillary Distance):**
   - Use the slider or on-screen settings to match the distance between your eyes.

---

#### Step 7: Install VR Content
1. **Access the App Store or Platform:**
   - Navigate to the VR app store on your headset or connected device.

2. **Download Starter Content:**
   - Start with free demos or beginner-friendly apps like tutorials or virtual tours.

---

#### Step 8: Begin Exploring
1. **Test with Simple Apps:**
   - Launch an app or game to familiarize yourself with the environment.
   - Practice using the controllers and interacting with the virtual space.

2. **Check Safety:**
   - Make sure the play boundary or guardian system is active.
